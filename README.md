## How to start

- Execute `yarn build or npm build` in the root directory to build the micro-frontend framework
- Start the main application and the two sub-applications separately, and ensure that the access port is the same as that configured in the main application
- Go to the `example` folder and start each sub-application separately
- The simple version of the micro front-end framework under `src` will be compiled into the dist directory
